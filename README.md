# SURGEON

This repository will hold the source code for SURGEON, our re-hosting system
built around the principle of transplantation.

SURGEON is presented at [BAR '24](https://ndss-bar24.github.io/program) under
the title "SURGEON: Performant, Flexible, and Accurate Re-Hosting via
Transplantation".

We are going to release the source code in the upcoming days, stay tuned!
